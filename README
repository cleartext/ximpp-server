The CheshiR MicroBlogging Platform
----------------------------------
This code is described in Chapter 14 of the book.

The chapter is divided into different sprints, and each of the sprints can
be run as separate scripts:
- CheshiR-Bot.py: The CheshiR XMPP IM Bot
- CheshiR-ConfigurableBot.py: Configuring the CheshiR XMPP IM Bot
- CheshiR-SimpleComponent.py: Scaling the CheshiR XMPP Service Using a Server 
  Component
- CheshiR-RegistrableComponent.py: Registering with the CheshiR Server 
  Component.
- CheshiR-Component.py: Extending the Server Component with Rosters

Caveats
-------
* CheshiR-Bot.py, CheshiR-ConfigurableBot.py, and CheshiR-SimpleComponent 
  assume that the mapping from JID to User is known by the backend. This
  mapping is currently hard-coded in the jidToUser and userToJID dictionaries
  in SimpleBackend.py. Normally, the service would keep track of this mapping
  through configuration via a web interface or such.
